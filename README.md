This Next.js project is dedicated to creating a Web Chat App based on a Figma design file. The Web Chat App design is available in a Figma community file, which you can access [here](https://www.figma.com/file/BcNhPtrX9pwbCFUWVNL8Zn/Chatting-app-with-summarizer-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=wAzxO7mh1glHjPCh-1).

`*** Note: Since this is a community project, your contributions will go toward an open-source software project rather than someone else's project, allowing you to use pull requests and issues to learn more and contribute more.***`

## Project Overview

The Apertre NextJS Project is all about bringing a Figma design to life by developing a functional and responsive Web Chat App. Here are the key features and goals of this project:

- **Web Chat App Design**: The project is centered around the design provided in the Figma file, ensuring that the final product closely resembles the provided design.

- **Next.js**: This project is built using Next.js, a popular React framework, which provides server-side rendering and other performance benefits. It is a great choice for creating web applications.

- **Responsive Design**: The Web Chat App will be designed to work seamlessly on various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience for all users.

- **Data Integration**: Depending on the project requirements, you might need to integrate real data or mock data to populate the Web Chat App with information.

- **Modular Components**: The project will be structured into reusable components, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.
